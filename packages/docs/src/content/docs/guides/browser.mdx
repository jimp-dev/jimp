Jimp can be used anywhere that javascript is supported. It can be used in the browser, in Node.js, or in a web worker.

Jimp comes with a pre-bundled browser version.
To use it simply import `jimp/browser` instead.

## Usage

There are two main ways to use Jimp in the browser.

### With hosted file

You can initialize a Jimp instance from a URL or a file path.

```ts
import Jimp from "jimp";

// Read a file hosted on the same domain
const image1 = await Jimp.read("/some/url");

// Read a file hosted on a different domain
const image2 = await Jimp.read("https://some.other.domain/some/url");
```

### With uploaded files

Or you can use Jimp with an `ArrayBuffer`.
Here we take a user's uploaded image and modify it to greyscale.

```ts
function handleFile(e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) {
  const reader = new FileReader();

  reader.onload = async (e) => {
    const image = await Jimp.fromBuffer(e.target?.result);

    image.greyscale();

    const base64 = await image.getBase64("image/jpeg");
  };

  reader.readAsArrayBuffer(e.target.files[0]);
}

input.addEventListener("change", handleFile);
```
