Jimp (JavaScript Image Manipulation Program) is a package that makes it easy to load and manipulate images in the browser and Node.js.
It aims to run anywhere that JavaScript is supported.

[Read the full documentation](/api/jimp/classes/jimp/) to learn more about the API.

```bash
pnpm add jimp
```

Jimp supports the following image formats:

- [bmp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMP_file_format)
- [gif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF)
- [jpeg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG)
- [png](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics)
- [tiff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIFF)

<Aside type="caution" title="Watch out!">
  Jimp is built on JavaScript implementations of image formats. These
  implementations are not optimized for performance and may allocate a lot of
  memory before using.
